GO Passport is an app for all universities that offer study abroad programs and want paperless study abroad fair. Through the app, students can create an account, log in, and start accumulating “stamps”. Stamps, which give summaries of study abroad programs they are interested in, can be acquired by manually searching through programs or by scanning QR codes at the fairs. In addition, students can also save contact information of representatives of those study abroad programs to get in touch with them later!
Go green, go international, GO Passport!
